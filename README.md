# MegaPrint-3D
This repository contains high-quality images of the 3D printer I built, showing off its impressive size and unique design. You'll find pictures of the printer in action, as well as close-up shots of its various components.

This project was a passion project born out of necessity. I have various other projects that require functional and cosmetic parts, and this printer was able to give my work another level of professionalism, as well as cut down build times by at least 50%.

I continue to maintain and update it with the most recent FDM printer technology. In the future, I plan to build a laser-powered metal 3D printer for high-stress structural parts.
